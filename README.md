# Plant Disease
Plant disease prediction using AI and ML uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to predict plant diseases accurately. This approach utilizes various technologies, including image processing, data analysis, and predictive modeling, promptly and diagnosing plant diseases. The main goal of this technology is to assist farmers in identifying diseases early on, allowing them to take preventive measures and avoid yield losses.

The process of plant disease prediction involves collecting data from various sources, such as weather reports, soil samples, and images of plants. This data is then analyzed using AI and ML algorithms to detect patterns and identify potential diseases. The models To improve their accuracy, the models are trained on large datasets, including healthy and diseased plants fits of using AI and ML for plant disease prediction are numerous. These techniques can quickly and accurately detect diseases, reducing the need for manual inspection and diagnosis. By identifying diseases early, farmers can take necessary steps to prevent the spread of the disease and protect their crops. This technology can also help farmers reduce the use of pesticides and other chemicals, leading to healthier plants and a cleaner environment.

In conclusion, plant disease prediction using AI and ML is a promising approach to improving crop productivity and reducing losses. As these technologies continue to advance, we can expect to see more accurate and efficient disease detection methods to help farmers manage their crops better and improve food security.

### ✅Save the model
The Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) provides highly optimized implementations of deep learning building blocks. With this open source, cross-platform library, deep learning application and framework developers can use the same API for CPUs, GPUs, or both—it abstracts out instruction sets and other complexities of performance optimization.

✅Building application using intel oneDNN:The Intel oneAPI Data Neural Network Library (oneDNN) contributes to the acceleration of big data analysis by providing highly optimised algorithmic building blocks for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.The library optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation to increase throughput and scalability.

✅Building a plant disease prediction application involves a significant amount of research and development. During the process, I likely learned a number of things, including:

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict the diseases in plants.

✅Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including historical crop yield data and soil data, to train our machine learning models.

✅Agricultural Trends: I likely gained insight into current trends in agriculture, such as the need for sustainable and efficient crop production.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 
Overall, building a plant disease prediction application is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and agricultural knowledge.
